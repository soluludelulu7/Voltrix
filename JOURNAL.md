Title:

Voltrix - "Power in Racing"

Description:

Voltrix is a cutting-edge energy harvesting system made specifically for racetracks. Every tile on the track transforms race cars motion and pressure into electrical energy that can be used. The power produced as vehicles speed across the surface will be captured and stored in batteries by using piezoelectric sensors. Racetracks can become smarter and more sustainable by using this electricity for pit-lane lighting, start lights, or even partial grid support.

Goals:

1.) Build a set of tiles that can withstand cars driving over them.

2.) Design a custom PCB for piezo inputs, voltage protection, and power regulation.

3.) Develop Arduino code to log energy output.

4.) Demonstrate power generation by lighting LEDs or charging small devices.

5.) Make an engineering journal with photos, PCB/CAD files etc and keep updating it along the way.
