Title:

Voltrix - "Power in Racing"

Description:

Voltrix is a cutting-edge energy harvesting system made specifically for racetracks. Every tile on the track transforms race cars motion and pressure into electrical energy that can be used. The power produced as vehicles speed across the surface will be captured and stored in batteries by using piezoelectric sensors. Racetracks can become smarter and more sustainable by using this electricity for pit-lane lighting, start lights, or even partial grid support.

Inspiration:

I got my inspiration from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAwsEUOUxw. This is a video about tiles made by PAVEGEN that genrate electricity by stepping on them. So, I thought why can't I incorporate my love for racing with this technology to make it a tad bit more efficient and reduce it's carbon footprint.

Goals:

1.) Build a set of (5-10) tiles that can withstand cars driving over them.

2.) Design a custom PCB for piezo inputs, voltage protection, and power regulation.

3.) Develop Arduino code to log energy output.

4.) Demonstrate power generation by lighting LEDs or charging small devices.

5.) Make an engineering journal with photos, PCB/CAD files etc and keep updating it along the way.
